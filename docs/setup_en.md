## Configuring your YAML File
### What is a YAML and why do I need one?
An YAML file is the way that you provide your player options to Archipelago.
See the [basic multiworld setup guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/setup/en) here on the Archipelago website to learn more.

### Where do I get a YAML?
After you installed the apworld, you can use the Archipelago Launcher to
generate a template yaml or download it from the github page.

## Joining an Archipelago Game in Death Road to Canada
1. Start the game after installing all necessary mods.
2. Create a **new save game.**
3. Select the **Archipelago** game mode from the mode selection screen.
4. Enter the correct settings for your Archipelago server.
5. Hit **Start** to begin the game. The game will stall for a few seconds while it does all item placements.

## Hints and other commands
While playing in a multiworld, you can interact with the server using various commands listed in the 
[commands guide](/tutorial/Archipelago/commands/en). You can use the Archipelago Text Client to do this,
which is included in the latest release of the [Archipelago software](https://github.com/ArchipelagoMW/Archipelago/releases/latest).
